First, I have to make the play button work. When I click the play button, the actual game appears.
Then, I need to make a random number generator (19-120)that declares the value of a treat. The value will change each round. 
There also has to be another number generator that declares the goal you have to get.
If I go over the goal, the game should end and a loss will be added to the chart of wins and losses.
All of the numbers will be randomly generated again at the end of the game, reseting the goal and values of the treats.
